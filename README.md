# at-calculator
A points calculator for the EVE Online Alliance Tournament.  All points and ships are now set for ATXIV, current as of July 7th, 2016.

To install, simply upload to any server and you are done!  It just uses javascript and HTML, nothing fancy!

Any questions or suggestions, please contact GREYGAL in game.  Isk donations welcomed :)
